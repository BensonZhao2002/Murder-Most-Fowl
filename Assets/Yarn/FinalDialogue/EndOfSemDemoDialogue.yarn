Athena: Who's up this late at night making such a ruckus. 
Athena: *cough cough* Luckily for them I'm too sick to do anything about it.

Athena: The early birds are up bright and early...
Athena: Unfortunately I am too...
<<ChangeLeftCharacter>>

???: I apologize for the inconvenience.
Athena: Great. Now I can get back to slee-
???: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
???: Oh dear heavens.
???: What on earth?
Athena: What's that all about?
Athena: I should check this out.
Athena: Oh dear Pheonix. How did this happen?
Athena: I suppose that's up to me to figure out.
Skipper: Excuse me ma'am, but I can't let you disturb the scene. I'm about to phone the police.
Athena: Yes, yes, I understand, but conveniently I'm a detective.
Skipper: A detective? But what needs investigating? The poor duck clearly hung himself.
Skipper: I don't want to mess with the scene until the police arrive.
Athena: Say, bellboy, if I can prove to you this “suicide” was in fact a murder, will you let me investigate further?
Skipper: I suppose… If this was a murder it would help to have a detective on the case.
Athena: It's a deal.

Athena: I'm Detective Athena Nox.
Chase: I assure you there's not much more than what meets the eye.

Chase: What do you want?
-> Where were you last night?
	Gander: Mallard and I were discussing private business matters.
	Athena: Business matters?
	Gander: As I said. Private.
	Gander: After we concluded, I decided to retire to bed early.
	Gander: I was woken by a large crash in the dining car, but assumed nothing of and went back to sleep.
	Athena: Did you hear anything else?
	Gander: I did not. The earplugs I put in after waking assured that.
	Gander: When I finally woke at an appropriate time, I heard Melissa's voice outside my quarters.
	Gander: When I exited, I was greeted by a locked parlor car door and noticed that bartender enter her dorm.
	Athena: Bartender? As in Morgana?
	Gander: Ah yes, that is her name, isn't it?
	Gander: Anyways, I confronted the bellboy about the locked door, but he claimed to have misplaced his key.
	Gander: My ask was for naught however, as the door was soon unlocked by someone. 
	Gander: Followed by a bloodcurtling scream.
	Athena: Is that when they found the body?
	Gander: ...
	Gander: Indeed.
-> What are your thoughts about Mallard?
	Gander: Mallard.. He was always quite troubled.

Athena: I've been listening to her music since the beginning of her career.
Athena: Oh my gosh and her new single, “Birds of a Feather”, is soooo good.
Athena: Good morning Miss Peacock.
Melissa: Hello darling. Quite an unfortunate morning, is it not?
Athena: Quite. I'm actually here to speak with you about this.
Melissa: Oh?
Athena: I'm a detective. Detective Nox. I may have a few questions for you about this.
Melissa: Oh my, am I a suspect?
Athena: Not at the moment, you're not. But there's something fishy about this scene, and I'd like some help to get to the bottom of this.
Melissa: I see.

	Melissa: I recall drinking with Morgana around last night.
	Melissa: She was such a darling and made me my favorite cocktail.
	Athena: What did you two drink?
	Melissa: She made me a Blue Lagoon, but I don't believe she actually had any alcohol.
	Athena: ...
	Melissa: We chatted for a while until I went off to bed. I don't remember exactly when, but I remember I woke up in the morning around 7:55 with a nasty hangover.
	<<jump PeacockQuestions1>>
-> What are your thoughts about Mallard?
	Melissa: He. Ugh. You see..
	Athena: It's ok. Take your time.
	Melissa: He and I used to get along fine, at least until I knew he was a swindler.
	Athena: Swindler?
	Melissa: The greedy duck agreed to pay me to perform at some of his lavish parties.
	Melissa: Except he never had any money to begin with.
	Melissa: You wouldn't think it by looking at him, but even I probably have more savings than he did.
-> Do you know if anyone would want to kill him?
	Melissa: My.. well I've overheard Mr. Gander was having troubles with Mallard.
	Melissa: I don't know much, but I believe it has something to do with Gander's disdain for Mallard's business practices.
	Melissa: I hear he blames Mallard for the current state of his company...
	Athena: what of the other passengers?
	Melissa: Well the bellboy has always given me strange vibes. There's just something.. off about him.
	Athena: That's hardly evidence.
	Melissa: I suppose not.
	Melissa: ...
	Melissa: As for Morgana, given that you're still alive, I doubt it was her.
	Athena: What do you mean?
	Melissa: *laugh* Well she used to be in love with that duck. If she were the ex killing type, I think you'd be the first she'd kill.
	Athena: She.. what?
	Melissa: Oh dear, did you not know?
	Athena: ... 
	Athena: Let's just move on.
	Melissa: Alright..

		Melissa: I asked about entering the parlor, but the poor thing said she lost them in her room. I admit I may have been a bit loud. I think I woke up Mr. Gander.
