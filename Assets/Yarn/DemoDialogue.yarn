Nancy: Tell me Chase, have you ever seen this Handkerchief before?
Chase: Never. It looks far too dirty for one I would own.
Nancy: Dirtied by a jelly stain, in fact.
Nancy: I also noticed some initials in the corner… CGW… Does that not fit your name? 
Chase: Could be anyone.
Nancy: Chase - Gander - Wilde. Quite the coincidence isn't it?
Chase: If it was mine, what of it?
Nancy: Chase Wilde Gander, did you eat my sandwich?
Chase: …
Nancy: What do you have to say for yourself?
Chase: It was delicious and I'd do it again.
